Here I'm trying to upload some image or thumnail in article detail page.

Step1:--Go to settings as you have uploaded or set static path file in settings, you need
to set path for uploading media files in settings.

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media')

Adding this in settings.py

Step2: adding this line in urlpatterns += static in urls.py in djangoprojects.
Import things
from django.contrib.static import static
from django.conf import settings

Because in settings.py file w ehave mentioned path of media file where it will
be saved or where to look into
So now passing MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL as parameters to static.
"urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL,document_root = settings.MEDIA_ROOT)"

Step3: Adding thumnail field in models.py
thumbnail = models.ImageField(default='default.png',blank=True)
We are gonna give default.png in case if Image path given by us not detected by
program.
Even article doesn't have image default will upload default.png it will create folder
for default.png 

Step4: Every time you make changes to models you need to migrate that change.
While doing makemigrations it will ask to install pillow

Step5: Go to admin page in broser and upload some image using thumbnail
But even after uploading image it won't be displayed in web page of  your article
When you go to django->Media folder-> you ruploaded image will be there


Step6:It does not show in web page Because we have not added it in html template
Access thumbnail property on the article and then output in the template

Step7: Go to article_detail add this 
 <img src="{{article_details.thumb.url}}" alt="">
 {{ }}= Because we are outputting some data
 Whenever we are using image we have access to the url property, so thumb will
 grab the url of the image from media file

 Error:  <img src="{{article_details.thumbnail.url}}" />
 I made mistake while typing thumbnail in article_detail.html Because
 in models.py I have used variable as thumbnail but and in views.py
 under article_detail you have used property as "article_details" same thing 
 you need to use in article_detail.html

 If you don't upload image by default planet shaped image will be uploaded.
