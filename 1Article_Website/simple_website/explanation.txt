1)ul{
    float:right;
    list-style-type: none;
    margin: 20px;
}
With this home about contact will visible in right side of web page with
home
about
contact
like above list format.
With margin 20px some gap between home text url bar of webpage will be there,

2)ul li{
    display: inline-block;
}
selecting li tag inside ul by : "ul li"
With above code :
 home about contact will look in single line.


3) Selecting a tag inside li inside ul by :
ul li a 
text-decoration: none means below home line won't be there


4) ul li a:hover{
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #000;
}
When you take mouse cursor on home text background ground color will become white
and text color will become black.

5) I've put logo
now reduce the size of the logo

6) setting max-width of main 

7) represeneting class by .
now "Top Movies list" make this look in center.
.title{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50% ,-50%);
}

8) changing color of h1
.title h1{
    color: #fff;
    font-size: 50px;
}

9) Using overlay upon background image: by doing this your image will look
transparent but your texts will appear in very good way like home about contact
will ook very good.
Do this inside header

<div class="button">
            <a href="#" class="btn">Movie Lists</a>
            <a href="#" class="btn">Songs Lists</a>
        </div>
        Now this should look under Top Movies list
But they are appearing in top.
So copy code of title 
.title{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50% ,-50%);
}
To make it look under Top Movie Lists
top: 60%;
