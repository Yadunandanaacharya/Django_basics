First I did like this under main urls.py

"url(r'^articleapp/',include('articleapp.urls')),"
So got error: 
########################################
Page not found (404)
Request Method:	GET
Request URL:	http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Using the URLconf defined in articlepro.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

^articleapp/
admin/
########################################
Later remove contents from ''

::url('',include('articleapp.urls')),
Now contents will be displayed.

2) USING TEMPLATES:
got to settings-> templates

3) Using templates inside views.py:
Due to spelling mistake I got error while giving path in views.py for 
home.html.
BEFORE:
def home(request):
    return render(request,'aricleapp/home.html')

AFTER: CORRECTED ONE:
def home(request):
    return render(request,'articleapp/home.html')

4)
But home should be there in main template. Do this later.
home.html is dynamic content. Do as step3.

Top 10 imdb rated movie stories.
->https://edition.cnn.com/articles <-
 For reference.
 Top 10 imdb rated movies and link to trailer.
 Top 10 laptops with their features and link to amazon.
 In home page above ehtings and Login and Signup buttons.

 When you press on Top 10 movies it should go to login page.

 5) Changed home.html
  a) Under style tag: {box-sizing:border-box} this will be used to
  put all Nav contents in navbar.
  If you change to content-box appearance of box for Home about contactus 
  box will change.
  b) With below code:
    body {
        margin: 78;
        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
        }
    When you give margin:0 there won't be any gap in top box that is navbar.
    So that nav-bar looks clean.

 c) In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) 
    and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”).
    For nav tag I have used '.' here,
    
    You can use the same class on multiple elements.
    You can use multiple classes on the same element. Denoted by .
    But ids are unique.
    or header and footer you can use id denoted by #

    To check difference change <div class="topnav"> to <div id="topnav">
    More changes will happen in web page.
    Class can be applied to multiple things.

    <a href="#about">About</a> Used ID which is Unique for about.

 d) Different property for navbar
 .topnav {
  overflow:-moz-hidden-unscrollable;
  background-color: #4b1515;
    }

You need to keep overflow to hidden for better visualization.
.topnav is class property applied mainly to div tag

e) 
<div class="topnav">
  <a class="active" href="#home">Home</a>
  <a href="#about">About</a>
  <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
  <div class="login-container">
    <form action="/action_page.php">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Username" name="username">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Password" name="psw">
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
These all div tags comes under class topnav whatver I'll see in top line
where home about contact us above black background.
For about used id, een or contact and home.

f) Even anchor tag has many properties:
a.hover

g) @media screen and (max-width: 660px) {
  .topnav .login-container {
    float: none;
  }
  With above code you can increase size of navbar where home about present.
  If you comment on this code then you will see home about contacts in separate
  tabs
  With half of the page covered with home in single full tab, like that about
  and contact.


h)
.topnav .login-container button:hover {
  background-color: rgb(228, 238, 228);
}
Used login-container class inside another topnav class.

i) For home button:
.topnav a.active {
  background-color: #2196F3;
  color: white;
