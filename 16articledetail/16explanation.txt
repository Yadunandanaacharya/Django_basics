Constructing article detail page: 
Now we can do like when you will enter slug detail in browser url it will
print respective slug in display    

These above things are handled by views.py for article_detail, we'll receive a slug
from the url
http://127.0.0.1:8000/articles/Hello-world/

then we are sending back slug to the browser

Now I'll do like find based on article respective slug from databse.

def article_detail(request,slug):
    # return HttpResponse(slug)
    artis = Article.objects.get(slug = slug)
    return render(request,'articles/article_detail.html',{'article': artis})

We will alter this function in views like this 
article = Article.objects.get(slug = slug)
slug =slug which we will get from article_detail function
so this function will lokk for article in the databse
now we can render a template and send that data to the template

returnining request and  article_detail
('articles/article_detail.html')

third parameter is data we want to send

by taking artis and sending it to article_detail.html so that we can output in
browser

create article_detail.html inside article

In article_detail.html we'll use different div tags for styling purposes
