Previously with usercreationform and authenticationform I was not loggin inside
application instead I was redirecting to article list, so in both cases like 
signup and login now I will try to log the user in 

1) In django logging function will do this job.
from django.contrib.auth import login
We use login funciton to login the user

2) When you check this login part in django admin first of all logout.
To login first of all we need to get who the user is so I'll create a variable
called 'user' 
user = form.get_user()
get_user is builtin django, authenticationform from post request is stored in variable
form inside login_view function so "user = form.get_user()" this will retrieve
the user who is trying to login

3) login(request,user)
pasing request and that user who wants to login

4) To test first logout from django/admin then try to login
with accounts/login now you will be redirected to article page.
Now if you try to go to admin, you won't get login page for admin.
