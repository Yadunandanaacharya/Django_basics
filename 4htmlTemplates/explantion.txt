To send html page to browser you need to create html "templates" directory inside
the root directory 

url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^about/$', views.about),
    url(r'^$/', views.homepage),
]

I missed typing $ symbol after about so I was geting error in homepage.
Be careful know why are you doing it.

^ this is used to match the starting of the line
$ this is used to match the end of the line.

The path method is designed to perform matches against exact strings, 
whereas the re_path method is designed to perform matches against patterned 
strings based on regular expressions.

url uses regular expressions    

Reference: https://www.webforefront.com/django/regexpdjangourls.html

strings prefixed with r'' (a.k.a. raw strings)

Many conditions are there before using r'^about/' and r'^about/index', there
is difference in matching between these two patterns    


from django.urls import re_path
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^about/index',TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')),
    re_path(r'^about/',TemplateView.as_view(template_name='about.html')),
]

django.urls.path was created for simplicity. Prior to Django 2.0, the 
only way to define urls paths was through regular expressions and the
 django.conf.urls.url method, something that created an unnecessary
  hurdle for newcomers. Therefore the existence of both django.urls.path
   and django.urls.re_path is rooted in Django's past, with the former
    designed to welcome newcomers and the latter designed to support more
     powerful url patterns & Django old-timers accustomed to defining url
      paths with regular expressions.


def about(request):
    render(request,'homepage.html')
first parameter will be request, next template present inside templates folder

above doesnot work since we need to mention templates to consider inside settings.

settings->TEMPLATES->'DIRS':['templates']
if you do like above django wil look for html files inside templates directory 
inside settings

Got this error:
The view djangoprojects.views.homepage didn't return an HttpResponse object. 
It returned None instead.
When I didn't use return in homepage function in views.py file.
