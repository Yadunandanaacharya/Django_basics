If you want to create a new user you can visit django admin web page add new user.

But this is not a good way. If I want to create a new Facebook account I can't
email FB admin that hey, create one account for me.

But we need to do like allow user to create a new user in front end,
we need to keep some kind of form, fill in the form and sign up for that account
when they have blogs they can add in front end, we can't allow user to login
to admin section and create blog over there.

For this I'll create a new app which allows above functionalities, we can create
template within that app

So django comes with buitin authentication system
settings->Installed apps->djano.contrib.auth

I'll take this djano.contrib.auth functionality with this functionality I can
create new user or add new user to the front end

1)To do this I'll create new app for user authentication

Create new app named accounts
Next very IMPORTANT  step register that accounts app in settings

2)Under accounts->urls.py
app_name = 'accounts'

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^signup/$',views.signup_view,name='signup')
    ]
3)Creating url for signing up 
4)Register this url in main url that is inside djangoprojects
url(r'^accounts/') : in main urls.py here we don't put $ symbol after / because
we are gonna look something after accounts app that is "signup" thing will come
later.

url(r'^accounts/',include('accounts.urls'))

5)create signup function in views.py in accounts app
def signup_view(request):
    return render(request,'accounts/signup.html')

6) create template folder inside accounts and create signup.html file in it.    W
where signup.html file will extend from base_layout.html file, mention block in there.
