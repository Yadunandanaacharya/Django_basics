How extending templates work: 
If we have 20 templates inside articles->templates->articles-> 25 html files

For each html file we need to mention head body style.css reference section.
So which is lot of work, not the best way of arranging templates

Better way is extending base template, so will have base template which will have all
of the global stuff, like head, load section, all of that goes to global base template

then our individual template like article_list.html extends that base template

Create base template inside djangoprojects->templates folder which is global template

base_layout contains all basic stuffs, cut load to body section from article_list.html

In base_layout Create div with class wrapper because that will be on every single
template

We can create various blocks and output those blocks inside this base template

{% block content %}
    {% endblock %}

    it's like in this base_layout template this is where we want blcok code
    content to go

Now in our article_list template we need to say this is extending from base_layout template

so base_layout template will consider content of article_list template as block.
