IMPORTANT: aFTER installing django when you'll ren code "django-admin.py"
you'll get error "django is not recognized as internal command"

Previously or by default python will be installed in the path:
c:users\yadua\appdata\roaming\python\(scripts and site packages)
With this above path I have tried many times where I was getting error.

So later I deleted all python files including "pip" in "c:users\yadua" path.

Now I have installed python in "C:/Python3.9" directly I have named it wrong, but don't ever try to
change this name also, it's saved in system path.

IMPORTANT: SO after installing Python directly in C folder and installing django through pip
I'm not getting any error while exceuting code "django-admin.py"
