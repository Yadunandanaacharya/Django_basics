User creation form.
In django buitin form is there

1)Go to views.py in accounts app.
create new instance of form and send that instance to html template.
Previously I have done like this sending article_lists and article_details to 
html templates
form = UserCreationForm()
I have invoked UserCreationForm with form variable and I can send it to html template.


2) Go to signup.html template to output form.
<form action="" method="post"></form>
create form with post.
giving class name as site-form
{{ form }} Outputting form
Createting one submit button

3) method post in form inside signup.html file. There are many requests like
get and post 
When you type url in address bar, that is a get request, you are receiving html files
from the server.
When we use post request sending data to the server and creating a new record in 
the server 
Get and post can go to same url

For example we can send get request to send
 this http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/signup to receive this page
And we can also send post request to above url to send data to the server

In both cases in django it'll fire signup_view function

a) action="index.html"
this means that action='/accounts/signup'
When you click submit button in web page, where you want to submit that data to
which url? We'll say submit to '/accounts/signup' this url.
So on the server signup_view function will be fired, and it will recieve that data

And we can also detect whether it is a post request or a get request

Important: inside signup.html type property mentioned in views.py file
{{ forms_are }}
