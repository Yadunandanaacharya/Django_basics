sAVING article to the database
For each article I have not mentioned author name of each article and 
I'm not even storing username in the database

In themodel we have 5 tags, but I'm not storing author, saving information 
where who's logged in who's created this article so that we can output 
that data associated with article, Authors and Users.

One way to link an article with Author is with "Foreign Key"

Foreign Key is a way to associate  record from one model example in our case article
model, with a record from another model in our case user model.
So we will associate article with User

1) open models.py add 
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
importing user
then I'll associate "User" model with "author" field.
Now author field will be user

So we need to makemigrations after doing changes
but before that I'll delete all articles because None of them have Author
information.
Then I'll do makemigrations

This Foreign key is not working giving error about
null constraint.


2)Next inside views.py in articles you need to save user details in database
storing it in variable called instance
Next attach author to this instance 

3) We've access to user with request, whenever user enter details article_create
function will be fired
