Now I can login, signup, post articles.
But when I'll visit any web page I need to show whether I'm logged in
or logged out.  
Like if I'm logged in then web page should show logout option else
when I'm logged out then web page should show login option.

Login and Signup button.

1) Open root templates folder-> base_layout.html
In that we have li tag inside that form is there which is used for login which shows
login button to everybody.
but we only want to show this to people who are logged in  or people who
are aunthenticated.

2) We can do 1) by template tag with if statement.
So if the user is aunthenticated then it shows form with login button
if they are not aunthenticated then it shows content of else 

login link: {% else %}
            <li><a href="{% url 'accounts:login' %}"></a></li>
            

3) Now run server you'll see login and signup optio in web page.
You see that option when you logoufrom create page

4) Create another option create a article.


ErROR: logout and NEW article buttonS ARE not DISPLAYING
