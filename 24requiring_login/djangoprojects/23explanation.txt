SO I need to create a button to logout when I press on that, it should send post
request and logout function will get fired.
So how that button will work on every page

1) On every page we have base_layout.html inside signup.html we're extending base_layout

2) In base_layout.html I'll create button so that button will appear
on every page
after h1 create post request, create it with form


<nav>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <form class="logout-link" action="{% url 'accounts:logout'" method="post">

                </form>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav>


]Mentionong accounts logout so when we click submit inside base_layout form, then
it's gonna make apost request later logout_view function inside views.py function
will be fired.

3) Important thing to remember: Whenever we make a post request we need to add 
csrf token

4) Now we have submit button in base_layout form, when we click it we'll send post 
request to accounts/logout

5) Now when you'll visit web page you'll see logout page there.

6) Now when you'll visit article page you'l see article page but when you 
try to go to admin page that time you'll see login page to admin not inside of 
admin page means admin page is already logged out.

7) Go to article-> now log in to admin page -> 
now go to article page without logging
out in admin page->Now press logout in article page ->
now agin enter url of admin, -> you'll see loin page of admin means 
it's already logged out.
