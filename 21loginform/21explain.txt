Create login form
I have created url pattern for signup in urls.py inside accounts.
I'll make anothe rfor login

1) created  url(r'^login/$',views.login_view,name='login'),
login url 

2) create login_view function in views.py
Same as the signup_view in this login could be also post request to login
or get request to login
If I enter url in browser like "localhost:8000/accounts/login" this could be 
get request.
After filling the form if I press login that will be post request
Do same like signup_view if request is post do something else do other thing.

3) For get request django has built in login with Authentication form
render you need to put outside the else

4)Create login.html file inside accounts/templates/accounts
change action: action="/accounts/login/"

So instead of hardcoding we can use {} brackest
action="{% url 'accounts:login' %}" anyways url will be taken from urls.py

5) Change in[put type: <input type="submit" value="Login">]

6) Error: else:
       ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block

7) Msiatke:  return render(request,'accounts/signup.html',{'forms_are':form})
Under login functio inside views.py inside render I had to put login.html
not signup.html so in web page title was signup

8)With post request in login we'll take user details, we'll try to aunthenticate 
it within form, so we need to pass data through AunthenticationForm() to validate 
it 
here def login_view(request):
    if request.method=='POST':
       form = AuthenticationForm(request=POST)
request.POST is not first parameter we need to pass it through 

9) if request.method=='POST':
       form = AuthenticationForm(data = request=POST)
       if form.isvalid():
           return redirect('article_for_listsare:list')
if form is valid pass it to article_for_listsare that is article list

10) After solving some mistakes when you try to login it will login 
to articles page.

11)If you enter wrong name it will give lodin error.    
But I can say that it's redirecting to article lists but not logging in
