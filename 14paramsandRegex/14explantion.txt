Url parameters and regex

We're outputting different blogs through templates

If I need to do like when I click on title link example
"Hello my first article" it should go through explanatio of that title.

For doing this we need to do some modifications in urls.py in articles app

example: if I press in url of browser like 
localhost:8000/articles/Hello-my-first-article 
then it should display contents of
that article

under models.py we have slug if article name will be there like"hello this is my first article"
then slug is like url of that article
you need to mention spaces with '-' symbol

title: "hello this is my first article"
slug: "hello-this-is-my-first-article"

To use slug as url we need to use something called, named-capturing-group

url(r'',views.article_detail)
adding this in urls.py under article
we don't need to write /articles it's taken care by main urls.py

Named_capturing_group: url(r'^(?p<slug>)')
and we can pass slug to function in views.py

url(r'^(?P<slug>)',views.article_detail), now we can send this to views as second
parameter. So url in browser can be anything like hyphen or letter or number 

url(r'^(?P<slug>[\w-]+)/$'  : \w for any letter number special character 
                            - for hyphen
                            + for any length of characters or letters
                            /$ means for end
        (?P<slug>[\w-]+)  : regular expression
        To create named capturing group parenthesis question mark (?)
        and inside <> inside angle bracket you can name it anything you want

def article_detail(request,slug):
    return HttpResponse(slug)
if you do like this you will get error.

http://127.0.0.1:8000/articles/Hello-world/
When you type this url of browser browser will print Hello-world
