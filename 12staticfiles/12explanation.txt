It's not normal in serving static file in django.
In nodejs it was very easy to serve static files through ejs or pug template engines.

static files are like imgae files, css or javascript files that we can send it 
to the client in djando serving static file is not simple
Save or give path of that image in html template this is not gonna work

We have to explicitly set static images inside our project and in our case 
we need to tell django to save our images.

While working for production server we would not let django to save our images
it's unofficial, we would another service AWS   

In debug mode only we are saving static file.

We need to import 
staticfiles_urlpatterns this thing lets us append to the urlpatterns django
can handle the serving of the static files 

staticfiles_urlpatterns this will check first of all in if we are in debug mode,
if we are in debug mode 

next step is in settings.py file go to bottom there you'll see about 
staticURl which addresses to find static file. Example if I want to find style.css 
file then I'll go to localhost:8000/static/style.css you can change path also

Djano doesn't know where to find static file. For that we are gonna add 
new property called STATICFILE_DIRS = ( os.path.join(BASE_DIR),'assets)
BASE_DIR OUR djangopath directory, assets is folder we need to create

in settings:
STATICFILES_DIRS = ( 
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'assets'),
    )

comma is very very important
