Now I know how to interact with database using django ORM

Admin area is area of site admins to control the content of the website, all the
contents or databases

We can control instances of models or databses.

 When you run server and go to browser type: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
 You'll get login page
When you enter you'll get error. Because that username and password 
does not exist there.

Now I'll create cp user means createsuperuser. Do this by using 
python manage.py createsuperuser

superuser has access to this admin area.

(leave blank to use 'yadua') since I'm using it I didn't type username
username: yadua
password: text1234

->runserver ->go to browser  -> admin enter details yu'll login to django admin page
for superuser green right will be there in admin page
not for normal user

IMP:
Here in django admin page we can't see article: because we have not set django 
that we want article to appear in admin area. We do need to do that to appear.

->go to admin.py 
-> register your Article model Here
from .models import Article
. to tell from current directory.

->admin.site.register()
This is we're telling django to register something on the admin site. 

Now django knows in admin section we want to see Article, when you open admin in browser
you'll see Article, where I had created 2 objects with 2 articles.

""	My name is Yadu
	Hello, world"" shwoing these things in browser, now if you remove __str__
    function in models.py you'll see only Article.objects
