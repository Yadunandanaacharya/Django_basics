Here I will take that slug and with respect to that slug in database I will print
content of that article.

For hello world title to that title only will print content of that with respect
 to slug

In our article_list.html we have made link of title name with '#' symbol.
So will output different url for different article 

But here we need to output individual slug and its contenets
We can do this by 'named-urls'

now we have access to slug url
We can't hardcode different urls here

below means url for list    
url(r'^$', views.article_list,name='list'): calling this link with list
url(r'^(?P<slug>[\w-]+)/$',views.article_detail, name='detail'):
above link as detail

Now if I want to output this above urls in template, instead of hardcode I can
just say use name='list'

to test it go to base_layout


we can assign url a name in urls.py file inside articles

inside base_layout.html

<h1><a href="{% url 'list' %}"></a></h1>
make these changes in base_layout.html file under global template

Using details in our template tag
<h2><a href="{% url 'detail' slug=iarts.slug %}">{{iarts.title}}</a></h2>
first mentioning url detail as it is in urls.py file
next for each article we need to mention slug with above code

Name spacing urls: Sometime django might get confused with details of author
details of article to solve this confusion we'll use name spacing

We'll do this in urls.py file
we can make like articles:detail and authors:detail
in both base_layout.html and article_list.html

<h2><a href="{% url 'articles:detail' slug=iarts.slug %}">
