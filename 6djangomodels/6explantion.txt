Start working with data, blog is collection  of articles, which 
is data

Models: Models in django represents  a table  in database.
Each type of data we have (e.g. Articles, users) is represented by its own model.
Each model maps to single table in a database.

In the code:
ex: class Articles():
        title = Models.CharField()
        body = Models.textfiles()

In the database:
id title body
1   hai  helo
2   baa  bell

We can also use django ORM to interact with database.

Model is represented by class in django.

class Article(models.Model):
this class Article will be inherited from models.Model, models is inbuilt in
django we're inheriting some basic functionality, we'll have title and body
inside Article class, date

title is small amount of text
We'll use charfield: small to large sized strings

slug = models.SlugField() find this in documentation
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/

TextField(): in here you can put input field dropdown field

date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
Here automatically populate current time to date field.
