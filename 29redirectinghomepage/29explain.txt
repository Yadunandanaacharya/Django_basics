In 28th folder New Article and Logout options are not working.

To redirect to home page we need to change root url
Inside djangoprojects 

We will change  urls for url(r'^$', views.homepage), in urls.py  to 
Article_list 

Importing article function from views
from articles import views as article_views

I have mentioned article_views because or else django will get confused with 
views

In browser when you go to root url like 
128:0.0.1/  / means home then article_list function from article/views should
get fired.

2) Next in base_layout.html file 
 <h1><a href="{% url 'home' %}"> changing like this 
 so that where in urls.py under djangoprojects I have given name as "home"
 for article_list that is url(r'^$', article_views.article_list, name='home'),
