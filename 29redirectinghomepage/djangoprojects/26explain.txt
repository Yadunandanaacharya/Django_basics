Whatever I typed it's deleeted so whatever you tyep jsut commit to
github after 30 minutes.























add csrf_token to the article_create.html

So when you enter details and hit submit button again we're sending data to the
articles/create. Same url we type in browser to get request

Change url pattern article_create.html file

15)
We have thumbanil where we will upload files so in form we need to mention
encryption type:enctype="multipart/form-data"

Above is to encoded form data uploaded in thumbanil
<form class='site-form' action="{% url 'article_for_listsare:create' %}" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">

IMPORTANT: WHENVER WE HAVE UPLOADING THINGS WE NEED TO HAVE enctype

16) SO when we get request :
if request.method == 'POST':
        form = forms.CreateArticle(request.POST)
        inside article_create function inside views.py under articles

Above code means it's validating against that model form.

17) Another thing we'll pass is request.FILES because when we upload files
they don't come along with post object, they will come with separate object 
called files on the request object itself.

18) Next check is that form valid
if form.is_valid()

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect 
imported redirect 


19) When we fill details and press submit button we're making post request we'll pas that data into form instance

20) Check in browser by enterring some details there it works, I have not created articles but checked form is valid
after entering details when you press create butto if it goes to articles list page then your code is working fine.
