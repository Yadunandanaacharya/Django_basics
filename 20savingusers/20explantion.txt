Taking users and save them into database.
I have created form using userCreationForm. Here I will save data entered in 
form by the user.

When we make a get request, then we run function signup_view and when we make post
request after clciking button Signup again signup_view function will be fired.

So I need a way to find whether it is a get or post request.
Get or post request comes bundled to request object to signup_view(request)
function

Under Signup.html in form section you need to use action="/accounts/signup/"
not index.html or else you will get error.

1)if request.method=='POST'
THEN WE TAKE the data from form and I'll validate it by creating new instance 
if request.method=='POST':
        form = UserCreationForm(request.POST)
request.post to access the post data.All the data come along with post data
Here I'm passing data to the new instance of the form essentially it's kind of 
validating data for me like 
a)is this data okay?
b) do passwords match
c)user already exist or not.

If it's valid save that data to the data form.
I'll use  form.is_valid() to check validity
returns true if it's valid else invalid.
if form.is_valid():
    form.save()
if data is valid saving that data in database

2) if data and user is valid, after saving them you need to display them in
article for that I'll use redirect.
""return redirect('article_for_listsare:list')""
"article_for_listsare" this one I've used in articles->urls and list I've used in
urls. Samething we need to use it here to display new article in list

3) If it's a get request
else:
    form = UserCreationForm()

4) You'll get error when you enter user details and password in the form.
regarding csrf token: csrf verification failed.
This token is security thing, when we send data to the server we need to send a token
to say look this data, this request has come from our  application, it's not come
from another application, so access this data. 
So I'll mention {{% csrf_token %}} this in signup.html file after form section.

5) go to admin section and login and check users there new user will be
added. But status will be not admin red cross means not a super user or admin

6) If normal user ramu tries to login with admin section it won't be possible for
him because admin is yadu
