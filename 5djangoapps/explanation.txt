                    djangoprojects
djangoprojects app          article app                account app
urls.py                   urls.py                   urls.py
                           views.py                 views.py 
                           /templates                /templates

here djangoprojects is root app inside djangoprojects ,  created 2 apps
When we biuld django application we split up into mini apps

If we want to create a blog, article app controls different articles

When we create article app inside views.py file is there, where django says that
python wants to have views.py inside each app, but it doesn't have urls.py app

Now we need to cretae template article_list where will we create we can't create
in "templates" it's like global template, but will cretae inside article app. 

So create templates folder inside article app
inside templates folder create same name folder article, this creating article 
folder inside templates is kind of namespacing.
Above is because if you create another html file named about.html file inside
article/templates-> here then django will get confused about which one to render
when you want to render the home page or about.html  

inside article/templates/article create article_list.html
Rendering article_list.html file when article_list fuction will be fired in 
views.py file

def article_list(request):
    return render(request,'article_list')
we can;t do like above code

def article_list(request):
    return render(request,'article/article_list')
When you do like this inside templates article will be there from there it will 
fetch .

register article app in settings.py also.

When you exceute code djangoprojects will take precedence because you have not
mentioned url of article in djangoprojects urls.py

Use include function for doing above

url(r'^article/$',include('article.urls))
when someone goes to /article it will look into article.urls.py file

I made a mistake by giving wrong path in views.py inside articles
def article_list(request):
    return render(request, 'articles/article_list.html')

You need mention path of html template in views.py correctly.
